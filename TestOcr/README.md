# TestOcr

To run this project you need to download two json files: the list of
videos and the API key that has permission for downloading the videos.

You can find these at:

```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rRmyixF62GeYIkn1tW1F81Jo3HH2c89r
```

And copy them:

```
apikey.json -> TestOcr/testocr-ios/json/apikey.json
full_videos.json -> TestOcr/testocr-ios/json/full_videos.json
```

The first time that you run this it will download all of the videos
and cache them on your device.
